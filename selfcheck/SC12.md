# Self Check 12

## 1. Definitions and Short Answers - functions

1. Given a for loop:

```python
 1  for i in L:
 2      print(i)
```

Can L be the following?  If so, what does the loop print?  If not, why not?
- `['a', 'b', 'c'] ` (YES)  
- `('a', 'b', 'c') ` (YES)   
- `'abc'` (YES)  
- `{'a', 'b', 'c'}` (YES)  
- `{'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c': 300}` (YES; Prints `a\nb\nc\n`)  
- `0xabcd` (NO)  
- `range(3)` (YES)  
- `23+4j` (NO)  

2. Given an iterable data structure `L`, 
- How do you obtain an iterator `r` of `L`? 

> ```python
> r = iter(L)
> ```

- Once you have an iterator `r`, what can you do to get the next value? 

> ```python
> print(next(r))
> ```

- What happens when you call next(r) but your iterator r has finished iterating over all values of L?

> It throws an `StopIteration` exception.  

3. Is there a limit to the number of iterators that you can create on the same iterable?
Assume you have 

```python
 1  D = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
 2  r = iter(D)
 3  L = [next(r) for i in range(3)]
 4  s = iter(D)
 5  M = [next(s) for i in range(2)]
```
after executing these five lines 
- What is the value of `L`?

> ```python
> ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue']
> ```

- What is the value of `M`?

> ```python
> ['Sun', 'Mon']
> ```

- What is the value of `D`?

> ```python
> ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
> ```

4. Recall the Vector class from the previous lecture,

```python
 1  import operator as op
 2  class Vector:
 3      def __init__(self, *v):
 4          self._v = list(v) # covert tuple to list
 5      def __repr__(self):
 6          return __class__.__name__+repr(tuple(self._v))
```

Suppose a class defines an `__iter__()` special method, and `v` is an instance of `Vector`.  
- How does Python intend that v's `__iter__()` special method be invoked by the programmer?  Hint: not `v.__iter__()`

> ```python
> iter(v)
> ```

- What kind of object should the __iter__() method return?

> `__iter__()` returns an iterator.  

- What is one simple way to implement Vector's `__iter__()` method, given that the iterator for Vector would essentially be the same as the iterator for the list `self._v`?  

> ```python
> def __iter__():
> 	return iter(self._v)
> ```

5. An alternative to part 4.(c) is to define a class for VectorIterator, and Vector's `__iter__()` method would instantiate and return it.  The code is as follows:

```python
 1  class Vector:
 2      def __iter__(self):
 3          return Vector_Iterator(self):
 4      ....
 5  class VectorIterator:
 6      def __init__(self, vec):
 7          self._vec = vec
 8          self._i = 0
 9      def __next__(self):
10          if self._i >= len(self._vec):
11              raise StopIteration
12          val = self._vec[self._i]
13          self._i += 1
14          return val
```

- In `VectorIterator`'s constructor, what is the purpose of initializing `_i = 0`?

> `_i` serves as an index for the `__next__()` special method used by the iterator.  

- Why does `VectorIterator`'s constructor need to set its `_vec` attribute to the iterable? Why isn't it enough to just keep track of its position `_i`?  

> Because the `__next__()` method needs to return the exact value, not just the index.  

- How does Python intend that the `__next__()` method of a `VectorIterator` instance `vi` be invoked?  Hint: not `vi.__next__()`  

> ```python
> next(vi)
> ```

- How does `__next__()` special method indicate that it has finished iterating all elements?

> It raises an `StopIteration` exception.  


6. Assume Vector is iterable, rewrite the following for-loop using a while loop and explicit `iter()` instantiation, `next()`, and catching `StopIteration` exception:

```python
 1  v = Vector(7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 6, 5)
 2  for i in v:
 3      print(i, end='')
```

> ```python
> v = Vector(7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 6, 5)
> 
> it = iter(v)
> while True:
>     try:
>         print(next(it), end = ' ')
>     except StopIteration:
>         break
> ```

7. Can any iterable object v be passed as arguments to
- `list(v)` (YES)  
- `max(v)` (YES)  

8. For the Blackjack game example, Card is declared as a class: 
```python
 1  class Card:
 2      ACE, JACK, QUEEN, KING = 'A', 'J', 'Q', 'K'
 3      FACES = (ACE,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, JACK, QUEEN, KING)
 4      SUITS = tuple(map(chr, (9824, 9827, 9829, 9830)))
 5      SPADE, CLUB, HEART, DIAMOND = SUITS # ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦
 6      def __init__(self, suit, face):
 7          self._suit = suit
 8          self._face = face
 9      def __int__(self):
10          if self._face in {Card.JACK,Card.QUEEN,Card.KING}:
11              return 10
12          return 1 if self._face == Card.ACE else self._face
13      def __str__(self):
14          return self._suit + str(self._face)
15      def __repr__(self):
16          return __class__.__name__ + \
17                repr((self._suit, self._face))
```

- Why is it a good practice to declare class attributes such as `SPADE`, `CLUB`, `HEART`, and `DIAMOND` even though Python3 handles unicode character literals such as '♠' '♣' '♥' '♦'.

> It is always better to avoid using Unicode characters in the source code because some end device might not support Unicode characters.  

- What is the purpose of special method `__int__()`?

> To denote the numeric value of a card.  

- Why declare a `__str__()` special method even though `__repr__()` also exists and can make a string that represents the card?

> There are many occasions where separate representations might be useful. In this case, the `__str__()` method returns a string of the card's suit followed by the card's face. On the other hand, the `__repr__()` method returns a string similar to the constructor call of the Card class.  

- Is Card class iterable?  Should it be iterable?  

> No and no.

- Is Card class for instantiating iterators?

> No.

9. Continuing with the BlackJack example, a separate class named Deck is also declared.

```python
 1  class Deck:
 2      def __init__(self):
 3          self._deck = [Card(suit, face) \
 4              for suit in Card.SUITS for face in Card.FACES]
 5      def shuffle(self):
 6          import random
 7          random.shuffle(self._deck)
 8      def __iter__(self):
 9          return iter(self._deck)
```

- Is Deck an iterable?  If so, is it required to implement the `__getitem__()` special method?

> Yes, Deck is an iterable. However, there is no need to implement the `__getitem__()` special method since we can simply use a `list_iterator` to accomplish the task.  

- Explain how the Deck class is able to create iterators by simply returning `iter(self._deck)` from its `__iter__()` special method.  Explain why this works.  

> `iter(self._deck)` returns a `list_iterator` that iterates the list attribute.  

10. In Single-player BlackJack, 

```python
 1  def BlackJack():
 2      D = Deck()
 3      D.shuffle()
 4      total = 0
 5      it = iter(D)
 6      while True:
 7          c = next(it)
 8          total += int(c)
 9          print(f'your card: {c}, total = {total}.', end='')
10          if total > 21:
11              print(f'you lose! total = {total}')
12              break
13          if total == 21:
14              print(f'you win! total = 21')
15              break
16          ans = input('More cards? [y/n] ')
17          if ans not in 'Yy':
18              c = next(it) # draw one more to test
19              print(f'next card {c}. You ' +\
20                    ('win' if total + c > 21 else 'lose'))
21              break
```

- What kind of object is it as created on line 5? 

> An iterator of a Deck instance.  

- What kind of object is returned by a call to next(it) on line 7 or 18? 

> a Card class instance.  

- Why doesn't this program have to handle the case where the iterator raises StopIteration exception when the deck is empty?

> Because it is logically impossible for a player to draw all the cards without having its accumulated sum above 21.  

11. Is the following a function or a generator?

- A: (Generator)  
```python
def X(z):
    for i in range(20):
        yield i
```

- B: (Function)  
```python
def Y(z):
    for i in range(20):
        return i
```

- C: (Generator)
```python
def K(z):
    for i in range(20):
        yield i
    return -1
```

12. If fib() is a generator for Fibonacci numbers, what is the syntax for
- instantiating a generator,
- generate the initial number,
- generate 10 more numbers after?
Fill in the blanks below.

```python
g = ____  # instantiate generator
init_num = ________
print('initial number = ', init_num)
for i in range(10):
    num = ______
    print(num)
```

> ```python
> g = fib()  # instantiate generator
> init_num = next(g)
> print('initial number = ', init_num)
> for i in range(10):
>     num = next(g)
>     print(num)
