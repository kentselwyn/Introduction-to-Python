# Self Check 14

## 1. Definitions and Short Answers - functions

1. Assuming you have
```python
import string
```
What is the value of
- `string.ascii_letters`  

> ```python
> 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
> ```

- `string.ascii_lowercase`  

> ```python
> 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
> ```

- `string.punctuation`  

> ```python
> '!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~'
> ```

- `string.whitespace`  

> ```python
> ' \t\n\r\x0b\x0c'
> ```


2. Why is it more preferable to check if a character `c` is a white space by
```python
if c in string.whitespace:
```
instead of 
```python
if c in {' ', '\n', '\t'}:
```
?

> Cleaner code, and uses less redundant memory space.  

3. Assuming you have
```python
from string import Template
s = Template('$x and $y')
```
What is the value of the following expressions?
- Code 1:
```python
s.substitute(x='hello', y='world')
```

```python
'hello and world'
```

- Code 2: 
```python
s.substitute(x=0x20, y=20)
```

```python
'32 and 20'
```

- Code 3:
```python
s.substitute(x=2., y=.2)
```

```python
'2.0 and 0.2'
```

4. In vim, 
- what do you type to search for the string `"or"`?  

> `/or`

- what do you type to find string `"or"` at the beginning of the line?  

> `/^or`

- what do you type to find string `"or"` at the end of the line?  

> `/or$`

- what do you type to find string `"or"` as the only string on the entire line?  

> `/^or$`

- what do you type to find words that end with `"or"`?  

> `/or\>`

- what do you type to find words that begin with `"or"`?  

> `/\<or`

- what do you type to find strings `"or"` that are not part of another word?  

> `/\<or\>`

5. In vim, what is the meaning of
- `:%s` (Replace all the content in the file)  
- `:%s/abc/xyz/` (Replace at most only one occurrence in every line)  
- `:%s/abc/xyz/g` (Replace all occurrences in every line)

import re
```
What is the value of

- Expression 1:
```
re.sub('-', '/', 'today 5-20-2019, tomorrow 5-21-2019')
```

> ```python
> 'today 5/20/2019, tomorrow 5/21/2019'
> ```

- Expression 2:

19. Is the difference between the built-in `float` type and `Decimal` class in the `decimal` module?

> The built-in `float` is inexact.  

- What is the value of 

```python
1.1 + 2.2 == 3.3
```
?

> `False`


- Assuming you have `from decimal import Decimal`, what is the value of
```python
Decimal('1.1') + Decimal('2.2') == Decimal('3.3')
```
?

> `True`

20. Assume you have `from fractions import Fraction`, what is the value of
```python
Fraction(16, -10)
```
?

> ```python
> Fraction(-8, 5)
> ```

21. Consider the first `Tkinter` program

```python
 1  import tkinter
 2  root = tkinter.Tk()
 3  f = tkinter.Frame(root)
 4  f.pack()
 5  l = tkinter.Label(f, text='Hello world')
 6  l.pack()
 7  b = tkinter.Button(f, text='Quit', command=root.destroy)
 8  b.pack()
 9  tkinter.mainloop()
```

- What kind of user interface object is `tkinter.Label` on line 5?

> Text

- What kind of object is `root.destroy` on line 7?

> Class method. `root.destroy` is to exit `tkinter.mainloop()`.

- Does line 9 run forever?  Or in what condition does line 9 finish?

> No, it will jump out of the loop once `root.destroy` is called.  

22. The second version of the Tkinter program is as follows, where the difference is highlighted in pink:
```python
 1  import tkinter
 2  root = tkinter.Tk()
 3  f = tkinter.Frame(root, width=200, height=150)
 4  f.pack_propagate(0)
 5  f.pack()
 6  l = tkinter.Label(f, text='Hello world')
 7  l.pack(side=tkinter.TOP)
 8  b = tkinter.Button(f, text='Quit', command=root.destroy)
 9  b.pack(side=tkinter.BOTTOM)
10  tkinter.mainloop()
```

- What is the purpose of line 4?

> To prevent the frame from shrinking to its compact form.  

- What is the purpose of line 7 and line 9?

> line 7 positions the `Label` instance in the top part of the frame. On the contrary, line 9 positions the `Button` instance in the bottom part of the frame.  


23. In the Calendar v2 example, the first page of the source code looks like this:
```python
 1  import tkinter
 2  root = tkinter.Tk()
 3  f = tkinter.Frame(root, width=250, height=200)
 4  f.pack_propagate(0)
 5  f.pack()
 6  import datetime
 7  today = datetime.date.today()
 8  current_year, current_month = today.year, today.month
 9  import calendar
10 cal = calendar.TextCalendar(6)
11 calstr = tkinter.StringVar()
12  calstr.set(cal.formatmonth(current_year, current_month))
13  l = tkinter.Label(f, textvariable=calstr,
14             justify=tkinter.LEFT,  font=('Courier', 12))
15  l.pack(side=tkinter.TOP)
16  b = tkinter.Button(f, text='Quit',command=root.destroy)
17  b.pack(side=tkinter.BOTTOM)
```

On line 13, why does it pass parameter `textvariable=calstr` (created and set on lines 11-12) instead of parameter `text=` some string value as before?

> Text is a constant string.  


24. Continuing with the same example, consider part of the second page of the source code, (abridged)
```python
18  def prev_month():
19      global current_year, current_month
20      current_month -= 1
21      if current_month == 0:
22          current_month = 12
23          current_year -= 1
24      calstr.set(cal.formatmonth(current_year, current_month))
...
52  pm = tkinter.Button(f, text='Prev', command=prev_month)
53  pm.pack(side=tkinter.LEFT)
...
56  tkinter.mainloop()
```

- How is the `prev_month` function (line 18) called?  Can any parameters be passed to it?

> `prev_month` is called when the button `pm` is clicked. No arguments were passed.  

- Why is line 19 necessary? 

> Yes, the function  needs to modify the global variables `current_year` and `current_month`.  

- What is the effect of line 24 on the user interface?

> Changes the shown calendar text to the previous month's dates.  

25. Continuing with the same example, one improvement is to replace the `prev_month` and `next_month` functions with the following:

```python
32  def shift_month(add_or_sub):
33      global current_year, current_month
34      current_month = add_or_sub(current_month, 1)
35      if current_month == 0:
36          current_month = 12
37          current_year -= 1
38      elif current_month == 13:
39          current_month = 1
40          current_year += 1
41      calstr.set(cal.formatmonth(current_year, current_month))
42  import operator
43  next_month = lambda : shift_month(operator.add)
44  prev_month = lambda : shift_month(operator.sub)
```

- Why is it better to combine the functionality of next_month and prev_month functions into one function?

> Clean.  

- Can this new function shift_month be passed as callback to (line 52 in the previous problem), i.e., 
`pm = tkinter.Button(f, text='Prev', command=shift_month)`  
?  Why or why not?

> formal parameter `add_or_sub` is `None`.  

- Can line 52 be written as
```python
pm = tkinter.Button(f, text='Prev', command=shift_month(operator.sub))
```
instead? Why or why not?

> This passes the result from a function call, not function object.  


- What is the difference between part c and the following:
```python
pm = tkinter.Button(f, text='Prev', command=lambda shift_month(operator.sub))
```
which one is correct?

> The latter.  

26. In calendar v3, the grid layout manager is used instead of pack.  What is the difference?

> Tabular formatting with two axes (row and column).  

27. What is the meaning of
```python
f.grid(row=0, column=0)  # f is an instance of tkinter.Frame
l.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=3)  # l is a tkinter.Label
```

> The first line of code puts the frame into the root's grid. On the other hand, the second line of code puts the label in (0,0) position but allows the `Label` instance to occupy three columns.  

28. What is the inlined equivalent code to
```python
[w.grid(row=1,column=i) for i,w in enumerate([pm, b, nm])]
```
where `pm`, `b`, `nm` are all instances of `tkinter.Button`?


> ```python
> pm.grid(row = 1, column  = 0)
> b.grid(row = 1, column = 1)
> nm.grid(row = 1, column = 2)
> ```

29. In the word finder example, the text to search is entered into the `Entry` widget that is set up using the following code
```python
pat_str = tkinter.StringVar()
pat_entry = tkinter.Entry(f, textvariable=pat_str)
pat_entry.grid(row=0, column=1)
```

What is the purpose of the text typed into the Entry?  Does it need to be processed first before being passed to `re.search`?

> The text typed into the Entry is recorded in `pat_str`. Consequently, before passing to `re.search`, one needs to `get` the string first.  

30. Continuing with the word finder example, a `ListBox` instance named `result_box` is used to display the matched results.   Explain the purpose of the following three lines of code that invoke methods on the list box:

```python
result_box.delete(0, tkinter.END)
for i, w in enumerate(matched_words):
    result_box.insert(i, w)
```

> First is to delete the old content in `Listbox`. While the rest is to insert the matched words into `Listbox`.  


31. Continuing with the word finder example,
- Explain what the second line does when reading the list of words from the file:

```python
fh = open('/usr/share/dict/words')
words = list(map(lambda x: x[:-1] if x[-1]=='\n' else x, fh.readlines()))
fh.close()
```

> It removes the extra newline in the back of a word if it exists.  

- Give an alternative code that uses str `split()` method in conjunction with `fh.read()` to achieve the same as the second line.


> ```python
> words = fh.read().split('\n')
> ```


32. Give the regular expressions and the corresponding description

- Strings containing six (or more) o's  

> ```python
> pat = '(.*?o){6}'
> print(re.findall(pat, 'onomotopoo'))
> print(re.findall(pat, 'patrick the paprika'))
> ```

- String containing exactly six o's  

> ```python
> pat = '([^o]*?o){6}'
> print(re.findall(pat, 'onomotopoo'))
> print(re.findall(pat, 'patrick the paprika'))
> ```

- Words that contain at least a 3-character sequence twice  

> ```python
> pat = r'(.{3}).*\1'
> print(re.findall(pat, 'ooolllooo'))
> print(re.findall(pat, 'patrick the paprika'))
> ```

- 8-character palindrome  

> ```python
> pat = r'.*(.)(.)(.)(.)\4\3\2\1.*'
> print(re.findall(pat, 'oolllloo'))
> print(re.findall(pat, 'patrick the paprika'))
> ```

- Word (of any length) in the form of the same substring twice.  

> ```python
> pat = r'\b([\w]*)\1\b'
> print(re.findall(pat, 'oollooll'))
> print(re.findall(pat, 'patrick the paprika'))
> ```

33. In the clock example, can the time be updated every second if you don't use a thread? Why or why not?

> The clock will not be updated since the program flow will remain in `tkinter.mainloop()` until the loop breaks.  

34. Continuing with the clock example, does the following code do?
```python
import threading
th = threading.Thread(target=update_clock)
th.start()
```

> The middle line creates another thread to perform `update_clock`. On the other hand, the last time starts running the thread.  

35. In the clock example, why is it necessary to have the line `quit = True` after `f.mainloop()`?
```python
f.mainloop()
quit = True
```
considering that the `update_clock()` function looks like

```python
import threading, time
def update_clock():
    while not quit:
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        clockstr.set(f'''Date: {now.year}/{now.month}/{now.day}
 Time: {now.hour:02d}:{now.minute:02d}:{now.second:02d}''')
        time.sleep(1)
```

> To break out of the while-loop.
